# Second Brain

A second brain you build with Claude Code. You collect sources, Claude reads them and keeps a living,
linked wiki of what they say, so it remembers and gets sharper as you go. It works for studying, research,
or any learning work.

## Start

**The fastest way.** Install Claude Code, then paste this to it and say "set this up":

> https://github.com/Krishna-kai/claude-second-brain

Claude clones it and tells you how to begin. No terminal needed. There is nothing to install or
configure, it is ready the moment it is cloned. It is just waiting for your first source.

**Or do it yourself:**

1. Install Claude Code (it needs a Claude subscription).
2. Get this folder and open it in Claude Code:
   `git clone https://github.com/Krishna-kai/claude-second-brain my-brain`
3. Drop a few sources into `raw/` (lecture notes, an article, a PDF, your own rough notes).
4. Say: **"read what is in raw and start my wiki."** Then ask it questions, or say "add this" as you
   collect more. To tidy up later, say "lint my wiki."

Claude builds the wiki in `wiki/`, keeps an index, and remembers between sessions. You collect and ask; it
does the reading, linking, and bookkeeping.

## Credit

We did not invent this. We borrowed brilliance from the open source community and built on it.

- The wiki pattern (raw sources, an LLM-built wiki, an index) is **Andrej Karpathy's "LLM Wiki"**:

- The idea of turning Claude Code itself into a second brain, a schema file that makes the agent a
  disciplined maintainer, is **Cole Medin's** work at Dynamous AI:
  https://github.com/coleam00/second-brain-skills
- The pattern of an agent that reads who it is and how to behave before it acts comes from the
  **soul.md and OpenClaw community** (Aaron Mars): https://github.com/aaronjmars/soul.md
- `CLOTH.md` builds on the field's idea of progressive disclosure and context engineering. The named
  contract is ours. The idea is not.

Plain markdown. No database, no lock-in. Your brain, your files.
