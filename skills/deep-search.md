# Skill: deep-search

A thorough, current-information sweep on a topic, pulling from several sources, not just one quick search.

Use this when the human wants the latest on something, or a careful answer that a single search would miss.
It works for any domain: science, law, finance, history, a product, a person, a current event.

This is bespoke on purpose. It orchestrates several search angles, several sources, and your own wiki,
rather than leaning on one generic search.

## Steps

1. **Frame the query into angles.** Turn the topic into three to five specific angles, not one. For example:
   the definition, the latest developments, the opposing view, primary sources, the numbers and dates.
   Different angles catch what a single query misses.
2. **Look local first.** Read `wiki/index.md` and open any pages on the topic. Note what the brain already
   holds and what is missing. Do not re-search what you already know.
3. **Search wide.** Run each angle through your web search. If a search MCP is set up (Tavily or similar,
   see `skills/README.md`), use it as well for fresher, deeper coverage; if its tools are not visible in
   your tool list, check your tool registry and load them before deciding none is set up. Pull from several
   sources.
4. **Check freshness and agreement.** Prefer recent, primary, and reputable sources. Note where sources
   disagree or where information looks dated. Say how current your answer is.
5. **Synthesise and save.** Write the findings into the wiki as a page, linked with `[[...]]`, every source
   cited (title, link, and the date you searched). Note the angles you searched, so the next sweep can
   refine them instead of starting over. Update `wiki/index.md`, add a line to `log.md`.

The difference from a quick search: several angles, several sources, your own wiki, freshness checked, and
the result saved so it compounds.
