# Setup

Your second brain is one folder, used by two apps. **Claude Code** maintains it. **Obsidian** lets you see
it. You install those two apps once; Claude does everything in between, from one URL.

## What you need

- **Claude Code** - the agent that builds and maintains your brain. Needs a Claude subscription (Pro is
  about $20/month and includes Claude Code; there's no free tier). Install it from Anthropic.
- **Obsidian** - free. This is how you see and walk your brain: the wiki, the links, the graph. obsidian.md
- **git** - free. Used to download and version your brain. It comes with most systems; git-scm.com if not.

Claude Code can't install these for you (they are apps, and one needs a subscription). Everything after
this, it can.

## Set up from scratch

Pick the line that matches what you already have, then do "The setup" below.

- **You have nothing.** Install Claude Code and Obsidian.
- **You have Claude Code but not Obsidian.** Install Obsidian.
- **You have Obsidian but not Claude Code.** Install Claude Code. Your brain needs the agent; Obsidian alone
  is just a viewer.

### The setup (same for everyone)

1. **Open Claude Code, paste this, and say "set up my second brain":**
   `https://github.com/Krishna-kai/claude-skills-second-brain`
   Claude sets it up and tells you which folder your brain is in. Nothing to configure, and no folder to
   make first.

   > **If you're the Claude agent reading this:** set up the user's brain without disturbing files they may
   > already have. If the current folder is empty, clone into it:
   > `git clone https://github.com/Krishna-kai/claude-skills-second-brain.git . && ls`. If it already has
   > files, clone into a fresh subfolder instead so nothing collides:
   > `git clone https://github.com/Krishna-kai/claude-skills-second-brain.git second-brain && cd second-brain && ls`.
   > Then read `CLAUDE.md`, follow its "If you were just pointed here" setup, and tell the user which folder
   > holds their brain.
2. **Open that folder in Obsidian:** File -> Open folder as vault, and pick the folder Claude pointed you to.
   Now you can browse your wiki, follow links, and see the graph.
3. **Drop a source into `raw/`** (a reading, a PDF, your notes) and say **"read what's in raw and start my
   wiki."** Or just ask Claude a question.

That's it. Claude works the brain; you watch it grow in Obsidian.

## Does it work without one of them?

- **Without Obsidian:** yes, but you lose the nice view. Claude still maintains everything, and the files
  are plain markdown you can read in any editor.
- **Without Claude Code:** no, not as a second brain. The agent is what reads your sources and maintains the
  wiki; Obsidian can't do that. The markdown files are still yours, just not self-maintaining.

## Later: deeper web search (optional)

The `research` and `deep-search` skills work out of the box with Claude's built-in web search. If you want
deeper, multi-source research, you can add a free search tool (Tavily) through Docker's MCP hub, and
`deep-search` will use it. That's a separate, optional step, with the full walkthrough and current
free-tier facts in [`docs/deeper-search.md`](docs/deeper-search.md). You don't need it to start.
